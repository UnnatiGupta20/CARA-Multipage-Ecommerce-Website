🛍️ Product listing with featured & new arrivals

🖼️ Product details page with image preview and size selector

📨 Newsletter sign-up

🧰 Tech Stack:-

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)

Icons: Remix Icon

Fonts: Google Fonts

Responsive Design: Media Queries



  
💡 How It Works:-

When the user clicks the cart icon on any product, product details (image, name, price, quantity) are stored in localStorage.

On the cart.html page, the script dynamically loads all items from localStorage and displays them in a table.

If the product already exists, its quantity is incremented instead of duplicating the row.
